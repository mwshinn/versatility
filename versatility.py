# This script implements versatility (Shinn et al., 2017), which
# describes how closely affiliated a node is with a network community
# structure.

# Dependencies:

# - python 3
# - networkx
# - scipy/numpy/matplotlib
# - bctpy: The module "bct" is bctpy, a port of the Brain Connectivity
#   Toolbox to Python.  The latest version supports Python3.
#   https://github.com/aestrivex/bctpy or "pip install bcpty".  If you
#   don't want to install bctpy, it should be pretty easy to modify
#   this code to remove the dependency.

# Here is a quick example to get you started:
#
#     import networkx
#     from versatility import *
#     G = networkx.karate_club_graph()
#     find_nodal_mean_versatility(G, find_communities_louvain, processors=2)
#     find_nodal_versatility(G, find_communities_louvain, algargs={"gamma" : 0.5})

# You've probably noticed that there are a lot of assert statements.
# This code will run a bit faster if you run "python -O", which will
# skip the asserts.  I can't say I recommend this, but if you really
# want to do so then be my guest...

# # The following line may make this run in Python2, though your
# # results may vary.

def find_nodal_versatility(g, alg, algname="", processors=1, algargs={}, it=200):
    """Computes the versatility of each node.

    This replaces find_nodal_uncertainty and
    find_nodal_uncertaintyplusplus as measures of how difficult it is
    to group a node into a module.  `g` should be a
    directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted graph, and `alg` should
    be a function compatible with the "alg" argument of the
    "consensus_matrix" function. The definition of nodal versatility
    is:

    $U_n = ∑_{i∈N} sin(π a_{n,i})/(∑_{i∈N} a_{n,i})$

    where $a_{i,j}$ is an element of the association matrix, i.e. each
    cell is the probability that algorithm `alg` will classify those
    nodes in the same module.  This assigns the property
    "[algname]vers" to each node, where "[algname]" is `algname`.  It
    also assigns the mean uncertainty in all nodes to the graph
    property "[algname]meanvers". This returns a dictionary of nodal
    versatility indexed by node.

    The optional `algargs` parameter is a dictionary that specifies
    what extra arguments should be passed to `alg`.  (This makes it so
    that you don't have to use partial functions for something as
    simple as a resolution parameter.)  For example, to specify the
    resolution parameter for the louvain algorithm to 1.5, set
    algargs={"gamma" : 1.5}.

    The `it` argument is the number of times to run the modularity
    algorithm when estimating the association matrix.  It should
    generally not be lower than 100, and there is little need to make
    it higher than 1000.  The default of 200 is a good tradeoff
    between precision and speed.

    The optional argument `processors` should be set to an integer
    greater than 0.  If it is greater than 1, consensus_matrix_par
    will be used instead of consensus_matrix.
